# GiveWP Design System

This is the design system for GiveWP intended for development. It's very simple and currently only
includes the foundational design system for both marketing and product development.

## Getting Started

The design system is simply a bunch of CSS Properties. There are no components, classes, or other
such things. You simply import the CSS file and use the properties in your own CSS.

There are two ways to install and use the design system:

Install via NPM:

```bash
npm install @givewp/design-system
```

Retrieve directly via the unpkg CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@givewp/design-system@master/css/foundation.css">
```

## Using pieces of the design system

The design system is broken up into several files. You can import the entire design system via the
`foundation.css` file, or you can import individual files.
